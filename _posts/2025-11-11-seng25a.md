title: Hyperparameter Optimization via Interacting with Probabilistic Circuits
openreview: mHbPRg5UJW
abstract: Despite the growing interest in designing truly interactive hyperparameter
  optimization (HPO) methods, to date, only a few allow to include human feedback.
  Existing interactive Bayesian optimization (BO) methods incorporate human beliefs
  by weighting the acquisition function with a user-defined prior distribution. However,
  in light of the non-trivial inner optimization of the acquisition function prevalent
  in BO, such weighting schemes do not always accurately reflect given user beliefs.
  We introduce a novel BO approach leveraging tractable probabilistic models named
  probabilistic circuits (PCs) as a surrogate model. PCs encode a tractable joint
  distribution over the hybrid hyperparameter space and evaluation scores. They enable
  exact conditional inference and sampling. Based on conditional sampling, we construct
  a novel selection policy that enables an acquisition function-free generation of
  candidate points (thereby eliminating the need for an additional inner-loop optimization)
  and ensures that user beliefs are reflected accurately in the selection policy.
  We provide a theoretical analysis and an extensive empirical evaluation, demonstrating
  that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in standard HPO and outperforms
  interactive BO baselines in interactive HPO.
