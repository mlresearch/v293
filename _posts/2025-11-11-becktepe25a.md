abstract: Medical Image Segmentation (MIS) includes diverse tasks, from bone to organ
  segmentation, each with its own challenges in finding the best segmentation model.
  The state-of-the-art AutoML-related MIS-framework nnU-Net automates many aspects
  of model configuration but remains constrained by fixed hyperparameters and heuristic
  design choices. As a full-AutoML framework for MIS, we propose Auto-nnU-Net, a novel
  nnU-Net variant enabling hyperparameter optimization (HPO), neural architecture
  search (NAS), and hierarchical NAS (HNAS). Additionally, we propose Regularized
  PriorBand to balance model accuracy with the computational resources required for
  training, addressing the resource constraints often faced in real-world medical
  settings that limit the feasibility of extensive training procedures. We evaluate
  our approach across diverse MIS datasets from the well-established Medical Segmentation
  Decathlon, analyzing the impact of AutoML techniques on segmentation performance,
  computational efficiency, and model design choices. The results demonstrate that
  our AutoML approach substantially improves the segmentation performance of nnU-Net
  on 6 out of 10 datasets and is on par on the other datasets while maintaining practical
  resource requirements. Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/automl/AutoNNUnet}.
