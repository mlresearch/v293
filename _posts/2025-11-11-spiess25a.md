title: 'AutoPDL: Automatic Prompt Optimization for LLM Agents'
openreview: CAeISyE3aR
abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) depends on how they are
  prompted, with choices spanning both the high-level prompting pattern (e.g., Zero-Shot,
  CoT, ReAct, ReWOO) and the specific prompt content (instructions and few-shot demonstrations).
  Manually tuning this combination is tedious, error-prone, and non-transferable across
  LLMs or tasks. Therefore, this paper proposes AutoPDL, an automated approach to
  discover good LLM agent configurations. Our method frames this as a structured AutoML
  problem over a combinatorial space of agentic and non-agentic prompting patterns
  and demonstrations, using successive halving to efficiently navigate this space.
  We introduce a library implementing common prompting patterns using the PDL prompt
  programming language. AutoPDL solutions are human-readable, editable, and executable
  PDL programs that use this library. This approach also enables source-to-source
  optimization, allowing human-in-the-loop refinement and reuse. Evaluations across
  three tasks and six LLMs (ranging from 3B to 70B parameters) show consistent accuracy
  gains ($9.06 \pm 15.3$ percentage points), up to 68.9pp, and reveal that selected
  prompting strategies vary across models and tasks.
