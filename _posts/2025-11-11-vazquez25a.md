title: 'The Ranking Trick: A Simple and Robust Alternative to Score-Based Regression
  for AutoML'
openreview: HsQrl2og2h
abstract: 'Traditional approaches to pipeline selection in automated machine learning
  (AutoML) typically rely on predicting the absolute or relative performance scores
  of candidate pipelines for a given task, based on data acquired from previous tasks—i.e.,
  meta-learning. This process can be complex due to the need for task-specific regression
  models and performance metrics. In contrast, rank-based methods estimate the relative
  ordering of pipelines, which aligns more directly with the decision-making nature
  of the selection task. Although ranking-based approaches have been explored previously,
  prior work often relies on computationally expensive pairwise comparisons or complex
  listwise formulations. In this study, we adopt a simpler alternative: reformulating
  the prediction target from absolute scores to rank positions—without modifying model
  architectures. This "ranking trick" enables the use of regression models while leveraging
  positional information. It is general and compatible with a wide range of existing
  AutoML techniques. Additionally, through controlled experiments, we show that these
  rank-based regression models are significantly less sensitive to noisy or overfitted
  meta-learning data, a common issue in practical AutoML settings. As a result, this
  approach enables more robust, metric-agnostic solutions and facilitates evaluation
  through ranking metrics such as NDCG and MRR. We evaluate this formulation across
  three large-scale OpenML benchmarks, demonstrating consistent advantages for ranking-based
  regression models. Furthermore, we explore its integration with Bayesian optimization
  and Monte Carlo Tree Search, yielding improved results in ranking quality. Finally,
  we identify a strong relationship between ranking-based metrics and key AutoML objectives
  such as final performance score and time-to-solution, providing  guidance for AutoML
  practitioners.'
