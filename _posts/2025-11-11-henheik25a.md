title: Revisiting Learning Rate Control
openreview: jRKujUVUZ6
abstract: The learning rate is one of the most important hyperparameters in deep learning,
  and how to control it is an active area within both AutoML and deep learning research.  Approaches
  for learning rate control span from classic optimization to online scheduling based
  on gradient statistics.  This paper compares paradigms to assess the current state
  of learning rate control.  We find that methods from multi-fidelity hyperparameter
  optimization, fixed-hyperparameter schedules, and hyperparameter-free learning often
  perform very well on selected deep learning tasks but are not reliable across settings.  This
  highlights the need for algorithm selection methods in learning rate control, which
  have been neglected so far by both the AutoML and deep learning communities. We
  also observe a trend of hyperparameter optimization approaches becoming less effective
  as models and tasks grow in complexity, even when combined with multi-fidelity approaches
  for more expensive model trainings.  A focus on more relevant test tasks and new
  promising directions like finetunable methods and meta-learning will enable the
  AutoML community to significantly strengthen its impact on this crucial factor in
  deep learning.
