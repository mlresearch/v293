title: Feasibility-Driven Trust Region Bayesian Optimization
openreview: jhm4qvrALj
abstract: Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for solving real-world optimization
  tasks under tight evaluation budgets, making it well-suited for applications involving
  costly simulations or experiments. However, many of these tasks are also characterized
  by the presence of expensive constraints whose analytical formulation is unknown
  and often defined in high-dimensional spaces where feasible regions are small, irregular,
  and difficult to identify. In such cases, a substantial portion of the optimization
  budget may be spent just trying to locate the first feasible solution, limiting
  the effectiveness of existing methods. In this work, we present a Feasibility-Driven
  Trust Region Bayesian Optimization (FuRBO) algorithm. FuRBO iteratively defines
  a trust region from which the next candidate solution is selected, using information
  from both the objective and constraint surrogate models. Our adaptive strategy allows
  the trust region to shift and resize significantly between iterations, enabling
  the optimizer to rapidly refocus its search and consistently accelerate the discovery
  of feasible and good-quality solutions. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness
  of FuRBO through extensive testing on the full BBOB-constrained COCO benchmark suite
  and other physics-inspired benchmarks, comparing it against state-of-the-art baselines
  for constrained black-box optimization across varying levels of constraint severity
  and problem dimensionalities ranging from 2 to 60.
