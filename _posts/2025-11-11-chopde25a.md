title: 'PiML: Automated Machine Learning Workflow Optimization using LLM Agents'
openreview: Nw1qBpsjZz
abstract: 'In this paper, we introduce PiML-Persistent Iterative Machine Learning
  agentic framework, a novel automated pipeline specifically designed for solving
  real-world machine learning (ML) tasks such as Kaggle competitions. PiML integrates
  iterative reasoning, automated code generation, adaptive memory construction, and
  systematic debugging to tackle complex problems effectively. To rigorously assess
  our framework, we selected 26 diverse competitions from the MLE-Bench benchmark,
  ensuring comprehensive representation across various complexity levels, modalities,
  competition types, and dataset sizes. We quantitatively compared PiML’s performance
  to AIDE—the best-performing existing baseline from MLE-Bench—across multiple evaluation
  metrics: Valid Submission rate, Submissions Above Median, Average Percentile Rank,
  and Medal Achievement Rate. Using the “o3-mini” model, PiML surpassed the baseline
  in submissions above median (41.0% vs 30.8%), medal attainment rate (29.5% vs 23.1%),
  and average percentile rank (44.7% vs 38.8%). These results highlight PiML’s flexibility,
  robustness, and superior performance on practical and complex ML challenges.'
