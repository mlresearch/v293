title: "\\textttconfopt: A Library for Implementation and Evaluation of Gradient-based
  One-Shot NAS Methods"
openreview: serEYBjyhK

abstract: 'Gradient-based one-shot neural architecture search (NAS) has significantly
  reduced the cost of exploring architectural spaces with discrete design choices,
  such as selecting operations within a model. However, the field faces two major
  challenges. First, evaluations of gradient-based NAS methods heavily rely on the
  DARTS benchmark, despite the existence of other available benchmarks. This overreliance
  has led to saturation, with reported improvements often falling within the margin
  of noise. Second, implementations of gradient-based one-shot NAS methods are fragmented
  across disparate repositories, complicating fair and reproducible comparisons and
  further development. In this paper, we introduce Configurable Optimizer (confopt),
  an extensible library designed to streamline the development and evaluation of gradient-based
  one-shot NAS methods. Confopt provides a minimal API that makes it easy for users
  to integrate new search spaces, while also supporting the decomposition of NAS optimizers
  into their core components. We use this framework to create a suite of new DARTS-based
  benchmarks, and combine them with a novel evaluation protocol to reveal a critical
  flaw in how gradient-based one-shot NAS methods are currently assessed. The code
