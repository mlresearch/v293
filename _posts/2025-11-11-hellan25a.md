title: 'Obeying the Order: Introducing Ordered Transfer Hyperparameter Optimization'
openreview: zGO4G8eGDl
abstract: In many deployed settings, hyperparameters are retuned as more data are
  collected; for instance tuning a sequence of movie recommendation systems as more
  movies and rating are added. Despite this, transfer hyperparameter optimisation
  (HPO) has not been thoroughly analysed in this setting. We introduce ordered transfer
  hyperparameter optimisation (OTHPO), a version of transfer learning for HPO where
  the tasks follow a sequential order. Unlike for state-of-the-art transfer HPO, the
  assumption is that each task is most correlated to those immediately before it.
  We propose a formal definition and illustrate the key difference with standard transfer
  HPO approaches. We show how simple methods taking the order into account can outperform
  more sophisticated transfer methods by better tracking smooth shifts of the hyperparameter
  landscape. The ten benchmarks are in the setting of gradually accumulating data,
  as well as a separate real-world motivated optimisation problem, and are open sourced
  to foster future research on ordered transfer HPO.
