title: Fast Bayesian Optimization of Function Networks with Partial Evaluations
openreview: KwykZvmTth
abstract: 'Bayesian optimization of function networks (BOFN) is a framework for optimizing
  expensive-to-evaluate objective functions structured as networks, where some nodes’
  outputs serve as inputs for others. Many real-world applications, such as manufacturing
  and drug discovery, involve function networks with additional properties - nodes
  that can be evaluated independently and incur varying costs. A recent BOFN variant,
  p-KGFN, leverages this structure and enables cost-aware partial evaluations, selectively
  querying only a subset of nodes at each iteration. p-KGFN reduces the number of
  expensive objective function evaluations needed but has a large computational overhead:
  choosing where to evaluate requires optimizing a nested Monte Carlo-based acquisition
  function for each node in the network. To address this, we propose an accelerated
  p-KGFN algorithm that reduces computational overhead with only a modest loss in
  query efficiency. Key to our approach is generation of node-specific candidate inputs
  for each node in the network via one inexpensive global Monte Carlo simulation.  Numerical
  experiments show that our method maintains competitive query efficiency while achieving
  up to a $16\times$ speedup over the original p-KGFN algorithm.'
