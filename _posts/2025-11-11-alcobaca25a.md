title: 'Exploring One Million Machine Learning Pipelines: A Benchmarking Study'
openreview: 0m9esX8kAg
abstract: Machine learning solutions are largely affected by the values of the hyperparameters
  of their algorithms. This has motivated a large number of recent research projects
  on hyperparameter tuning, with the proposal of several, and highly diverse, tuning
  approaches. Rather than proposing a new approach or identifying the most effective
  hyperparameter tuning approach, this paper looks for good machine learning solutions
  by exploring machine learning pipelines. For such, it benchmarks pipelines focusing
  on the interaction between feature preprocessing techniques and classification models.
  The study evaluates the effectiveness of pipeline combinations, identifying high-performing
  and underperforming combinations. Additionally, it provides meta-knowledge datasets
  without any optimization selection bias to foster research contributions in meta-learning,
  accelerating the development of meta-models. The findings provide insights into
  the most effective preprocessing and modeling combination, guiding practitioners
  and researchers in their selection processes.
