title: 'Ax: A Platform for Adaptive Experimentation'
openreview: U1f6wHtG1g
software: https://ax.dev
abstract: Optimizing industry-scale machine learning systems involves resource-intensive
  black-box optimization. Adaptive experimentation substantially improves the sample
  efficiency of such tasks compared with naive baselines (such as grid or random search)
  by utilizing surrogate models and sequential optimization algorithms. Ax \url(https://ax.dev)
  is an open-source platform for adaptive experimentation. Ax is highly extensible
  and full-featured, and is used at scale at Meta.  We discuss Ax’s design, usage,
  and performance. Off the shelf, Ax achieves state-of-the-art performance in a wide
  range of synthetic and real-world black-box optimization tasks in machine learning,
  engineering, and science.
