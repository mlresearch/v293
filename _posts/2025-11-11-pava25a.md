abstract: 'Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has become a powerful method for automating
  the design of deep neural networks in various applications. Among the different
  optimization techniques, evolutionary approaches stand out for their flexibility,
  robustness, and capacity to explore diverse solutions. However, evaluating neural
  architectures typically requires training, making NAS resource-intensive and time-consuming.
  Additionally, many NAS methods lack generalizability, as they are often tested only
  on a small set of benchmark datasets. To address these two challenges, we propose
  a new efficient NAS framework based on evolutionary computation, which reuses available
  pretrained weights and uses proxies to reduce redundant computations. We initially
  selected a reduced RegNetY search space and incorporated architectural improvements
  and regularization techniques for training. We developed a dataset-aware augmentation
  selection method to efficiently identify the best transform for each dataset using
  zero-cost proxies. Additionally, we propose a ranking regressor to filter low-potential
  models during initial population sampling. To reduce training time, we introduce
  a weight-sharing strategy for RegNets that reuses pretrained stages and transfers
  the stem from parent to child models across generations. Experimental results show
  that our low-cost (T0) and full EG-ENAS (T6) configurations consistently achieve
  robust performance across eleven datasets, outperforming Random Search (T1) and
  simple Evolutionary NAS (T2) with competitive results in under a 24-hour time budget
  on seven validation datasets. We achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on one and surpass
  the 2023 Unseen NAS Challenge top scores on four datasets. The code is available
