title: 'AutoML Algorithms for Online Generalized Additive Model Selection: Application
  to Electricity Demand Forecasting'
openreview: ADeWkyOVYA
abstract: Electricity demand forecasting is key to ensuring that supply meets demand
  lest the grid would blackout. Reliable short-term forecasts may be obtained by combining
  a Generalized Additive Models (GAM) with a State-Space model, leading to an adaptive
  (or online) model. A GAM is an over-parameterized linear model defined by a formula
  and a state-space model involves hyperparameters.Both the formula and adaptation
  parameters have to be fixed before model training and have a huge impact on the
  model’s predictive performance. We propose to optimize them using automated Machine
  Learning. For this purpose, we define an efficient modeling of the search space
  (namely, the space of the GAM formulae and adaptation parameters) as well as mutation
  and crossover operators on this space and apply an evolutionary algorithm to select
  the best parameters. We evaluate our method on short-term French electricity demand
  forecasting which demonstrates the relevance of the approach.
