title: Transferrable Surrogates in Expressive Neural Architecture Search Spaces
openreview: TEup1DJTzd
abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) faces a challenge in balancing the exploration
  of expressive, broad search spaces that enable architectural innovation with the
  need for efficient evaluation of architectures to effectively search such spaces.
  We investigate surrogate model training for improving search in highly expressive
  NAS search spaces based on context-free grammars. We show that i) surrogate models
  trained either using zero-cost-proxy metrics and neural graph features (GRAF) or
  by fine-tuning an off-the-shelf LM have high predictive power for the performance
  of architectures both within and across datasets, ii) these surrogates can be used
  to filter out bad architectures when searching on novel datasets, thereby significantly
  speeding up search and achieving better final performances, and iii) the surrogates
  can be further used directly as the search objective for huge speed-ups.
