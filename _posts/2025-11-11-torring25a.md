title: 'CATBench: A Compiler Autotuning Benchmarking Suite for Black-box Optimization'
openreview: oVjC8FjZEH
abstract: Bayesian optimization is a powerful method for automating tuning of compilers.
  The complex landscape of autotuning provides a myriad of rarely considered structural
  challenges for black-box optimizers, and the lack of standardized benchmarks has
  limited the study of Bayesian optimization within the domain. To address this, we
  present CATBench, a comprehensive benchmarking suite that captures the complexities
  of compiler autotuning, ranging from discrete, conditional, and permutation parameter
  types to known and unknown binary constraints, as well as both multi-fidelity and
  multi-objective evaluations. The benchmarks in CATBench span a range of machine
  learning-oriented computations, from tensor algebra to image processing and clustering,
  and use state-of-the-art compilers, such as TACO and RISE/ELEVATE. CATBench offers
  a unified interface for evaluating Bayesian optimization algorithms, promoting reproducibility
  and innovation through an easy-to-use, fully containerized setup of both surrogate
  and real-world compiler optimization tasks. We validate CATBench on several state-of-the-art
  algorithms, revealing their strengths and weaknesses and demonstrating the suite’s
  potential for advancing both Bayesian optimization and compiler autotuning research.
