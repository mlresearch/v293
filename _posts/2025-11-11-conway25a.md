abstract: 'Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines are central to applying
  large language models (LLMs) to proprietary or dynamic data. However, building effective
  RAG flows is complex, requiring careful selection among vector databases, embedding
  models, text splitters, retrievers, and synthesizing LLMs. The challenge deepens
  with the rise of agentic paradigms. Modules like verifiers, rewriters, and rerankers—each
  with intricate hyperparam- eter dependencies have to be carefully tuned. Balancing
  tradeoffs between latency, accuracy, and cost becomes increasingly difficult in
  performance-sensitive applications.  We introduce syftr, a framework that performs
  efficient multi-objective search over a broad space of agentic and non-agentic RAG
  configurations. Using Bayesian Optimization, syftr discovers Pareto-optimal flows
  that jointly optimize task accuracy and cost. A novel early- stopping mechanism
  further improves efficiency by pruning clearly suboptimal candidates. Across multiple
  RAG benchmarks, syftr finds flows which are on average $9\times$ cheaper while preserving
  most of the accuracy of the most accurate flows on the Pareto-frontier. Furthermore,
  syftr’s ability to design and optimize also allows integrating new modules, making
  it even easier and faster to realize high-performing generative AI pipelines. syftr
