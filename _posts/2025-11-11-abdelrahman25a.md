title: 'SmartCal: A Novel Automated Approach to Classifier Probability Calibration'
openreview: XPtubBurd2
abstract: Accurate probability estimates are crucial in classification, yet widely
  used calibration methods like Platt and temperature scaling fail to generalize across
  diverse datasets. We introduce SmartCal, an AutoML framework that automatically
  selects the optimal post-hoc calibration strategy from a pool of 12 methods. Using
  a large-scale knowledge base of 165 datasets in multiple modalities and 13 classifiers,
  we show that no single calibrator is universally superior. SmartCal employs a meta-model
  trained on the meta-features of the calibration splits and classifier output to
  recommend the best calibration method for new tasks. Additionally, Bayesian optimization
  refines this selection process, outperforming standard baselines and random search.
  Experiments demonstrate that SmartCal systematically improves the calibration over
  existing approaches such as Beta Calibration and Temperature Scaling. This tool
  is freely available with a unified interface, simplifying the calibration process
  for researchers and practitioners.
